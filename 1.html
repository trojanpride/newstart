<h2> html </h2>
HTML이란 웹페이지와 웹애플리케이션을 만드는 <strong><u>표준</u>언어</strong>이다.
  <p>HyperText is the <a href="https://www.naver.com/" target="_blank" title="네이버">method</a> by which you move around on the web
  — by clicking on special text called hyperlinks which bring you
  to the next page. </p> The fact that it is hyper just means it is not
   linear — i.e. you can go to any place on the Internet whenever yo
  u <br>want by clicking on links — there is no set order to do things in.
